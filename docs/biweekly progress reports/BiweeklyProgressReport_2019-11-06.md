## Team 8 | Biweekly Progress Reports
##### Members: Nina Baumgartner, Jonas Ph. Kocher, Lukas Schacher

## Weeks #5-6
Done:
* Backend:
    * PUT for userprofile
    * Implemented services (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) which works with Postman tests
* Frontend:
    * Login but token is in json body and not yet processed
    * Reworked page structure
    * Implemented routing
    * Added pages for profile and service home
    * Added alerts so users get feedback after registration, login, etc

TODO:
* Write appropriate frontend functions so it talks correctly to backend
* Login functionality with JWT -> Maybe outsource auth service
* Approval of new accounts by admin
* Some kind of search function for the services
* Fix alerts regarding http errors (currently only "object Object")
* RegistrationForm 2.0 with password regex and matcher, and so on

Issues:
* Anastasija left the course due to personal reasons. We are now under even more time pressure than before.
* Still fighting with Login and Tokens
* Registration Form 2.0 (not pushed) doesn't correctly transmit data to backend
