## Team 8 | Biweekly Progress Reports
##### Members: Anastasija Novikova, Nina Baumgartner, Jonas Ph. Kocher, Lukas Schacher

## Weeks #3-4
Done:
* Registration now works from backend with postman and also with form from frontend.
* Rearranged and refactored lots of files, not much clearer overview.
* Password is saved as hash in database.

TODO:
* Login and session management (with json web token).
* Rearrange layout from frontend, page is a bit crowded right now.
* Mandatory fields in registration form and password entry not as plaintext, check for password confirmation
* Milestone 2
* Fix default values in database
* Maybe email confirmation

Issues:
* Actually getting postman to show us the data we put into the database.
* Correctly transferring data from frontend to backend.
